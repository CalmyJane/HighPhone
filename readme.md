This repo contains arduino code and files for an old rotary dial telephone that's upgraded with an ESP32 to be used as amusement for Parties and Festivals.

Planned features are:
-Playback of audio clips when a number is dialed
-Recording of audio to a specified number for others to listen to
-Answering machine if unknown number is dialled -> calls will be logged for aftermovie
-(further future) Having multiple phones automatically connect to each other over Wifi or maybe other protocols to enable phonecalls between them
